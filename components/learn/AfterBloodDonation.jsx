            <div>During a blood donation we take 470ml of blood, which is just under a pint.

                Your donation is transported to one of our blood centres where it is tested and processed before being
                issued to hospitals. If you’ve ever wondered what happens to your blood donation view our animation.

                After donation, your body has an amazing capacity to replace the blood you have given.

            <div>
                To help you stay well after you have given blood, we advise you to:

                keep the pressure dressing on your arm for about 30 minutes after you have given blood, and the plaster
                on for 6 hours
                rest for a short time after giving blood
                eat and drink – you will be encouraged to have at least 2 drinks and a snack before you leave
                avoid using the donation arm to carry anything very heavy for the rest of the day
                avoid having a hot bath after you have given blood
            </div>
            <div className="h5 mt-3">Feeling unwell after giving blood?</div>
            <div>If you feel faint (light headed or dizzy, hot, sweating, trembling, shaky or nauseous) lie down
                immediately, rest until you feel better and drink plenty of fluid.

                Any bruising is usually harmless and will disappear over time. Read more advice about bruising after
                donation.

                If bleeding recurs, sit down, raise your arm and press on the area where the blood is coming from for at
                least 5 minutes.

                If you become unwell (other than a cold or cold-sore) within 2 weeks following your donation, or if you
                believe there is a reason your blood should not be transfused to a patient
            </div>
        </div>
    );
